- comparison between Trustless & Less 
- Possible attributes of DID
---> **Follow Up**
- Blockchain in a day - by Peter

## This meeting
* Lead = Xinrong Ding (Design Thinker) 

* Quick recap of Study Day Stories
* "it is a mixture of solutions and what we want to have"

# User Stories
### Dimensions 
* Identity 
* Attestation / attributes / Verifiable Credentials
* Technology
* Organization (governance)
* MVP Use case
* Onboarding

#### Identity / DID
- Establish someones digital identity 
- 2 kinds of identities: known (humans) & unknown (only contributors) ?
- Provide "contributing member" credentials

- Establishing identity by peer identification?
- ID is more like a placeholder
- DID associates with real life person

- DID is for broader use
- LCU DID: used for getting specific things (credits, credentials, regulations, etc.)
- confirm with digital signature
- acquire project members
- What matters is what you do (within the community)

*questions that arise*
- How to validate a DID (e.g. social reputation?) 
- Which information is needed to be validated?
- reward users, knowledge attestations for attending workshops or seminars

**Questions regarding Identity**
- How to validate a DID? 
- I miss an overview of all community members (and skillset)

#### Attestation / attributes (verifiable credential)
- Use did to get to know a member better (What that person is interested in, confirmed past project)
- Preferably no multiple ID for one person
- Digital, signature
- Validation of the attestation (by the lisk center for example)
- The process by which certain 

**Questions regarding**
- Rights attached to certain attestation
- How to allow a third party to provide attestations?

#### Technology
- Requirements --> based on the [LiskSDK](lisk.io)
- Being compatible with existing and future solutions 

**Questions regarding Technology**
- Which existing and future solutions should the network be compatible with?

#### Organization
- Off-Chain Community: Governance of the LCU Community
  - To coordinate the members together
  - As an LCU members, I want to know what other members are working on so that I can collaborate with them.

- On Chain: Governance of the Identity network 
  - Governing the Identity Network (the rights attached to certain attestations & verifiable credentials)

- The follow up steps would be to create a DAO for the LCU 
- Relation to Lisk (sponsor, create proof of concept)

#### MVP Use case
- Register DID on a Lisk Sidechain with LiskID (wallet) as identifiable object (identity)
- Assign "LCU Member" attestation to the account
- LCU Community DAO

#### Onboarding

#### Open & Federated 
- Open everybody can validate 
- Federated: not everybody 

- Less or trustless model: preferably the trustless solution (otherwise you can not create an identity, or a company can revoke your identity)
- only able to revoke attestations



## Questions to answer afterwards (in blogpost)
- Why use a blockchain with digital identity? 
- What is the difference between a trusted and trustless model?
-
