# The Project Process

## Next Meeting (week of eastern)

**First** (date to be decided)
- write down the 3 best use cases for DID
- comparison between Trustless & Less 
- Possible attributes of DID

**Second**
- Blockchain in a day - by Peter

## This meeting
* Lead = Xinrong Ding (Design Thinker) 

* Quick recap of Study Day Stories
* "it is a mixture of solutions and what we want to have"


# Goal: What does Lisk Center want to be able to do?
Lisk Center Utrecht would like to be able to provide digital identities an LCU Member attestation and manage these attestations. 
And be able to leverage the full blockchain ecosystem with its solution.

# User Stories

### Dimensions 
* Identity 
* Attestation / attributes / Verifiable Credentials
* Technology
* Organization (governance)
* MVP Use case
* Onboarding

#### Identity / DID
- Establish a digital identity 
- Provide "contributing member" credentials

- Establishing identity by peer identification?
- ID is more like a placeholder
- DID associates with real life person

- DID is for broader use
- LCU DID: used for getting specific things (credits, credentials, regulations, etc.)
- confirm with digital signature
- acquire project members
- What matters is what you do (within the community)
- Preferably no multiple ID for one person

*questions that arise*
- How to validate a DID (e.g. social reputation? Or should this only be an attestation?) 
- Which information is needed to be validated?

#### Attestation / attributes (verifiable credential)
- Use did to get to know a member better (What that person is interested in, confirmed past project)
- Digital, signature
- Validation of the attestation (by the lisk center for example)
- reward users, knowledge attestations for attending workshops or seminars
- I miss an overview of all community members (and skillset)

*Questions regarding*
- Rights attached to certain attestation
- How to allow a third party to provide attestations?

#### Technology
- Requirements --> based on the [LiskSDK](lisk.io)
- Being compatible with existing and future solutions 

*Questions regarding Technology*
- What is the advantage of using LiskSDK?
- Which existing and future solutions should the network be compatible with?

#### Organization
The digital identity will be used by the LCU Community to be able to provide verifiable credentials and in the long run to be able to manage the community (and its projects) in a decentralised manner. 

- Off-Chain Community: Governance of the LCU Community
  - To coordinate the members together
  - As an LCU members, I want to know what other members are working on so that I can collaborate with them.

- On Chain: Governance of the Identity network 
  - Governing the Identity Network (the rights attached to certain attestations & verifiable credentials)

- The follow up steps would be to create a DAO for the LCU 
- Relation to Lisk (sponsor, create proof of concept)

# MVP Use case
- Register DID on a Lisk Sidechain with LiskID (wallet) as identifiable object (identity)
- Assign "LCU Member" attestation 


# Questions to answer afterwards (in blogpost)
- Why use a blockchain with digital identity? 
- What is the difference between a trusted and trustless model?
