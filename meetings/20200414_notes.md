# Meeting Notes

### DAO Proposal by Marc
We talked through the DAO proposal - [@googleDocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VtGxVzJCWs_ogd8_g-9ChyLq1h3HKLMtuWLE04KL8As/edit?usp=sharing)

#### It proposes several layers in a DAO for Lisk Center.
* Starting with a **RootDAO** that will be able to define proof of membership; founder, member, anonymous.
* The **RootDAO** is able to create subDAOs for other DAOs
* The layered structure will provide the possibility for experimenting with the subsequent DAOs & implementing new standards. 


We also discussed some tokenomics aspects. 
* Due to the complexity of token systems we decide to let it out of the root DAO
* we will experiment with Tokens in a follow-up iteration. 

#### Next Up
* Adding information to the RootDAO Document (everybody)
* Discuss on Monday the 20th
* To go to the next phase of a functional design
